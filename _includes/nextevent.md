RWOT12, the next Rebooting the Web of Trust event, will occur in Los Angeles, California in Spring of 2023! We look forward to our first return to North America since RWOT7 in 2018! In the meantime, take a look at our [RWOT11 repo](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague) for what went on at our September 2022 workshop in The Hague. [Draft Documents](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/tree/master/draft-documents#readme) contains our work from the workshop and [Final Documents](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/final-documents/README.md) has the finished work to date.
