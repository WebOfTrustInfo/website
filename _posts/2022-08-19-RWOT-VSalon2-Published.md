We've now published the full summary of the Out of the Box 2052 Virtual Salon, held earlier this year, at our [events page](/events/). Thank you to everyone who participated, to help guide our vision for what identity and the internet might be like in 30 years.

We had great talks about protection, consensus, co-creation, communities, and nourishment: how the electronic world can make us our best selves. Of course, to get there we have to guide its development, and that's what Rebooting the Web of Trust is all about.

Please take a look at [the overview](/salons/outofthebox2052) for many insights and imaginations of our future!

And remember that you can sign up for [RWOT11 in the Hague](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-xi-2022-the-hague-tickets-347605426187), our first design workshop since before the pandemic began! Advance Purchase Pricing ends on August 26th!
