### Covid Protocols

As a live, in-person event, we will be observing protocols designed to minimize the risk of spreading or catching Covid-19. These protocols will be based on requirements by local governments, including both the Netherlands and the Hague, as well as our best judgment for providing a safe and healthy environment for all participants. Details will be confirmed as we get closer to the actual event.

All participants should be prepared for masking, vaccination, and testing requirements.
