## About the Event

Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) is a five-day in-person facilitated design workshop focused on decentralized identity. Its goal is to gather together participants interested in creating decentralized digital systems for our lasting mutal benefit. At each workshop, participants work together to create artifacts that can influence the future direction of decentralized identity. That includes [65 white papers](/papers/) to date, but also code, spreadsheets, and other concrete deliverables.

Please see our ["About" pages"](/about/) for more information.

## Health Protocols

As a live, in-person event, we will be observing protocols designed to minimize the risk of spreading or catching COVID-19 and other communicable diseases. 

We require that all attendees test for COVID-19 each day of the conference, prior to starting the day’s event. Everyone will be given enough tests for the entire week of the workshop. Attendees who test positive or have other contagious indications (fevers, infections, etc.) should not attend until the appropriate quarantine period has passed, which we have determined using German health rules as of early 2023, which requires at least five days quarantine after the onset of symptoms and for tests to become negative.

Attendees are encouraged to wear masks if desired, but will not be required to do so. Those individuals with exceptional concerns should not attend, but are welcome to collaborate on papers remotely. 

RWOT will provide lanyards in three (3) colors. Attendees may choose to wear a **red** lanyard to indicate that they are social distancing and therefore request 6 feet of space, a **yellow** lanyard to indicate discomfort with physical contact, or **green** lanyard to indicate no concerns around close interactions.

At the moment, travel to Germany is clear of pandemic-era requirements or restrictions, but be sure to check before you head out, as new travel restrictions are always possible.
