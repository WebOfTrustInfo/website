## Travelling to Germany

This section will go into specifics on how to make sure your stay here
is well organized and comfortable.

### Rules and Regulations

Germany is similar to a lot of European countries in rules and
regulations. The most important things to know for visitors are
collected
[here](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/visa-service/).

#### Visa 

Citizens of the EU/Schengen area do not require a visa to travel to
Germany.

British and American citizens do not require a visa but do need to
comply with the travel checklist found
[here](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/visa-service/visabestimmungen-node).

## Getting to Cologne and Hürth

The event will be located in Hürth, which is just outside of Cologne.
Travel is recommended by public transport, as this is the easiest
option.

### By Air & Rail

You have many options to get to Cologne/Hürth. 

Cologne Airport does
not have many direct flight options from US or Asia, but does easy
flight connections from all major EU flight hubs. Another convenient
option is to fly to Frankfurt, and a 1-hour train from
Cologne.

-   Flight to Amsterdam (\~3 hours from Cologne): [https://www.schiphol.nl/en/](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/)
-   Flight to Frankfurt (\~1.5 hours from Cologne): [https://www.frankfurt-airport.com/en.html](https://www.frankfurt-airport.com/en.html)
-   Flights to Cologne: [https://www.cologne-bonn-airport.com/en/flights/flight-destinations.html](https://www.cologne-bonn-airport.com/en/flights/flight-destinations.html)
-   (Inter-) National rail (Germany): [https://www.bahn.de/]{.underline}(https://www.bahn.de/)
    -   Mobile app: [https://www.bahn.de/service/mobile/db-navigator](https://www.bahn.de/service/mobile/db-navigator)
-   (Inter-) National rail (Netherlands): [https://www.nsinternational.com/en](https://www.nsinternational.com/en)
   -   Mobile app for international travel: [https://www.nsinternational.com/en/nsinternationalapp](https://www.nsinternational.com/en/nsinternationalapp)
      - It may be that you get cheaper tickets into Germany when using the NS International app instead of booking through Deutsche Bahn.
-   (Inter-) National bus: [[https://www.flixbus.de/](https://www.flixbus.de/)

### By Car

Traffic in the area and in the city can be very busy, especially during
rush hour, and parking (on the street or in parking garages) can get
quite expensive.

Uber and taxi services are also available. As always, take a good look
at the prices in advance.

## Getting around Cologne and Hürth

## Accomodations

You might want to decide whether you want to stay in Hürth or in
Cologne. Hürth is closer to the venue and Cologne offers more social
activities. From the Cologne train stations (Köln Hauptbahnhof, Köln
West, Köln Süd) you can reach the event location in Hürth in 10-25
minutes.

The event will be held in Hürth, a suburb of Cologne, however, many will
prefer accommodations in Cologne. The nearest station in Cologne is Köln
Süd, which is about 10 minutes away with regular service to Hürth.

There are many hotel options in the area. One recommendation is: ibis
Koeln Centrum, Neue Weyerstraße 4, 50676 Köln, Duitsland

Cologne, like other major European cities, has a lot of hotels in
various price categories, as well as a lot of privately rented
apartments. Hürth is a smaller town, but also there you can find hotel
rooms and privately rented apartments. You can see a full selection on
any accommodation search website, such as
[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) or
[airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/).

There will be a trade fair in Cologne at the same time as the RWOT, so
hotels will be booked out quickly or may become more expensive. Please
book your hotels as soon as possible.

Many more hotels (including all major international chains) are in the
city center of Cologne, which is easily reached via public transport
(see Travel to the venue and around the city). You can see a full
selection on any accommodation search website, such as
[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) or
[airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/).
