The first RWOT Virtual Salon, on Decentralized Identity & Privacy, gave participants the opportunity to discuss the intersection between decentralized digital identity and privacy, with the goal of producing a single statement that the entire salon was able to agree was an important statement on the future of identity.

## Key Topics

Participants briefly spoke on a variety of topics, which were roughly grouped into the following categories of discussion:

* **Abuse.** How do we counter abuses, often by large corporations, such as coercion to reveal information?
* **Accountability.** How do we protect the marginalized, disenfranchised, and otherwise vulnerable?
* **Advocacy.** How can we convince people of the needs or demands of privacy?
* **Community.** Can we have privacy while also supporting communities?
* **Correlation.** What do we do with identity solutions that create correlation?
* **Culture.** What are different cultural expectations about privacy? How can we support them?
* **Perspective.** How can we view privacy in different ways?
* **Portability.** How do we create a healthy and moral environment for privacy competition?
* **Regulation.** Is regulation sufficient to protect privacy?
* **Relationships.** How do we release information in different relationship contexts?
* **Security.** How do we review and certify privacy?
* **Technology.** How do technologies like decentralization or blockchains impact privacy?
* **Usability.** How do we create privacy without sacrificing usability?

These are not all of the topics that were discussed, nor even all of topics within these categories. Nonetheless, they represent a cross-section of the topics at the salon.

## The Statement

To arrive at a group statement, we voted on three categories that we felt were the most important. They were: abuse (14 votes); accountability (11 votes); and culture (7 votes). We then divided into three groups, each of which created 1-3 statements related to these categories as potential releases for the salon. We then voted on the statements, to determine which had both strong interest and rough consensus. We agreed on the following statement:
	 
> "Privacy for decentralized identity must support the full range of social collaboration: individuals, life partners, families, small firms, corporations, communities of interest, neighborhoods, nation-states, and other forms of association.
>
> "No matter how ephemeral or long-lived these collaborations, we need solutions that safely enable all forms of individuals acting alone or in concert. 
>
> "For example, a group of friends should be able to plan and pay for a vacation using any number of services, without sharing usernames and passwords, revealing unnecessary information, or being subject to undue bureaucracy.
>
> "This is a joint statement from contributors at the Decentralized Identity & Privacy 2021 salon, organized by Rebooting the Web of Trust http:/weboftrust.info/salons/decentralizedprivacy2021"

Other statements with high interest, but where we could not reach rough consensus without our time frame, related to the need to hold the powerful accountable (where our prime disagreements came in saying how to do so proactively, without forcing victims of privacy violations to be lightning rods for corporate displeasure) and  the importance of local context to identity statements (where we couldn't agree on whether the statement was concretely meaningful and where we stumbled over how to deal with abusive contexts, such as authoritarian systems). Obviously, with more time each of these topics could turn into interesting statements or even papers of their own, but we were seeking rough consensus over a three-hour salon.

## An Overview

## Key Quotes

People spoke adroitly on these topics over the course of the salon. What follows are statements from individuals which we felt were interesting, insightful, or clever. We've probably missed as many as we collected. These quotes and paraphrases have been categorized after the fact, and represent individual thoughts, not the consensus of the salon. Some quotes been cleaned-up or paraphrased, to retain the original thought (and as much as possible the original words), but to make them more readable as an excerpt.

#### The Importance of Privacy

"Privacy forms the foundation of our freedoms."
{: .notice--primary}

#### Designing Identity

{% capture notice-1 %}
"How we build an identity system that is not implicitly a violation of privacy is one of the big problems I see ahead of us."

"I see some people making arguments that any use of a public ledger is incompatible with privacy."

"I've seen a lot of differences when you're running a digital identity system that is user-led versus issuing a self-sovereign or a digital-identity account that you manage on behalf of individuals." 
{% endcapture%}

<div class="notice--primary">{{ notice-1 | markdownify }}</div>

#### Describing Identity

{% capture notice-2 %}
"I'm increasingly thinking of attributes like the reflections on Plato's cave: your identity is on the other side, and all you are seeing are the shadows dancing on the wall."

"We can mistake the attributes that we're dealing with for the person who is underlying them."
{% endcapture%}

<div class="notice--primary">{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}</div>

#### About Aggregation & Correlation

{% capture notice-5 %}

"No matter how they try to do them [even trying to make them anonymous and distributed], trackers for advertising are identifying and indelible."

#### About Lock-In

"A lot of privacy tools are blatantly anti-competitive."

<div class="notice--primary">{{ notice-12 | markdownify }}</div>

## Questions about the Salon

#### What is RWOT?

RWOT is <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>. We held nine in-person design workshops from 2015-2019. Our goal was to produce actual work product at the workshops, which has resulted in the production of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/pastevents.html">over 50 white papers</a> on the future of identity of the internet, including incubation of the DID standard. We've also produced a few code libraries and demonstrations.

We are planning to return to in-person workshops in 2022. This was our first virtual salon.

#### What is a Virtual Salon?

A virtual salon is a meeting of interested people to discuss a topic. In keeping with the work focus of RWOT, our goal is to drive each salon toward producing a short statement which we think speaks to the future of identity on the internet. 

#### How Many People Attended?

We had approximately 30 participants and a facilitation team of about a half-dozen.

#### Who Attended?

Our participants were worldwide. In the US, we had participants from Hawaii and California to Boston, New York, and Puerto Rico. Worldwide, participants also came from Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and the UK.

#### How Did You Run Your Virtual Salon?

We used Zoom for our conversations, supplemented by <a href="https://app.mural.co/">Mural digital whiteboards</a>, which we laid out in advance with post-its for participants to write statements on and with space to organize and re-organize those digital post-its. We also used Zoom breakout rooms to support smaller discussions where everyone could have a say. 

#### What Were the Guidelines for the Conversations?

All conversation was protected by the Chatham House Rules:

> “The Chatham House Rule reads as follows: When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.”
